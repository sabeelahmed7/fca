## **Understanding the System Reminders Section**

In the System Reminders section, you will find the following key elements:

2. **Status**: Displays the current status of the reminder.
3. **Type**: Defines the reminder frequency, which can be **Yearly**, **Quarterly**, or **Monthly**.
4. **Estimated Date**: Shows the date on which the reminder is expected to trigger.
5. **Created On**: The date when the reminder was initially configured.
6. **Action Buttons**: Use these buttons to **edit** or **delete** reminders.

   * **Subject**: Provide the **title** of the reminder in **both English and Arabic**.

4. After saving, the system will calculate the **estimated date** for the reminder, based on your input.
5. Ensure that the **estimated date** corresponds correctly to when the reminder should trigger.

## User Tips

{% hint style="info" %}
1. **Ensure Correct Interval Days**: Always double-check the interval days to avoid reminders being sent too early or too late. A wrong interval can misalign with deadlines.
2. **Verify Reminder Type**: Make sure to select the appropriate reminder type (Yearly, Quarterly, or Monthly) based on the frequency of the required notification. Selecting the wrong type may cause reminders to trigger at inappropriate times.
3. **Cross-Check Estimated Dates**: After creating a reminder, review the **estimated date** to ensure it aligns with the desired trigger date.
4. **Consistent Naming in English and Arabic**: Use clear and descriptive titles for reminders in both languages to avoid confusion for users across different departments.
5. **Regularly Review System Reminders**: Periodically check the reminder configurations, especially after system updates or changes in organizational processes, to ensure they are up to date.

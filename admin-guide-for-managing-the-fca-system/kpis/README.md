#### User Tips:

1. **Always Double-check Filters**: Ensure that you have selected the correct objective and division from the dropdown before making changes to avoid editing the wrong KPI.

3. **Confirmation Before Deletion**: Always double-check before deleting any KPI to avoid accidentally removing crucial data. Implement confirmation pop-ups for added security.
